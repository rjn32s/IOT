# import cv2

# # Remember, opencv by default reads images in BGR rather than RGB
# # So we fix that by the following
# img = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
# # Now, for small images like yours or any similar ones we use for example purpose to understand image processing operations or computer graphics
# # Using opencv's cv2.imshow()
# # Or google.colab.patches.cv2_imshow() [in case we are on Google Colab]
# # Would not be of much use as the output would be very small to visualize
# # Instead using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow() would give a decent visualization
# cv2.imshow(img)
